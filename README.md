Got it! I’ll draft a **complete README** tailored for your Full-Stack Blogging Platform so it matches the submission guidelines and is ready to paste into your GitHub repo. You can tweak deployment URL and time spent later.

## 🛠 Setup Instructions (Local)

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/blogging-platform.git
cd blogging-platform
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create `.env` in the project root:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:YOUR_PASSWORD@ep-wandering-tooth-ahtqagcf-pooler.c-3.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

4. **Push database migrations to Neon DB:**

```bash
npx drizzle-kit push:pg
```

5. **Run the development server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

* Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## 🗂 Database Seeding

> Optional if you want initial data

1. Add seed data in `prisma/seed.ts` (or your preferred seed file).
2. Run seed script:

```bash
npm run seed
```

---

## 🧩 tRPC Router Structure

```
/src/server/trpc/
├── routers/
│   ├── posts.ts      // CRUD operations for blog posts
│   ├── categories.ts // CRUD operations for categories
│   └── index.ts      // combines all routers
└── context.ts        // tRPC context for DB access
```

* **posts.ts:** handles creation, update, deletion, fetching single & multiple posts, and filtering by category.
* **categories.ts:** manages category CRUD operations.
* **index.ts:** combines all routers into a single tRPC API router.

---

## 📌 Trade-offs / Decisions

* Chose **Markdown editor** over rich text editor to save development time.
* Limited landing page to **3 sections** to focus on polished core features.
* **Authentication** not implemented (per requirements).
* No image uploads (can be added as a bonus).

---

## ⏱ Time Spent

* **Approx. 12–16 hours** over 7 days

---

## ✅ Notes

* Focused on **clean, type-safe code** with tRPC + TypeScript.
* Fully functional CRUD operations, responsive UI, and category management are implemented.
* Deployment is live on Vercel and connects to Neon DB.

If you want, I can also **write a shorter “Vercel Deployment Instructions” section** so your README is even cleaner for submission and ready to copy-paste.

Do you want me to do that?
